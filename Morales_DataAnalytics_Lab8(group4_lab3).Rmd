This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Lab 8

lab1_svm12
```{r}
# load the kernlab package
library(kernlab)
# train the SVM
svp <- ksvm(xtrain,ytrain,type="C-svc",kernel='vanilladot',C=100,scaled=c())
#Look and understand what svp contains
# General summary
svp
# Attributes that you can access
attributes(svp)
# For example, the support vectors
alpha(svp)
alphaindex(svp)
b(svp)
# Use the built-in function to pretty-plot the classifier
plot(svp,data=xtrain)

```

lab1_svm13
```{r}
cv.folds <- function(n,folds=3)
 ## randomly split the n samples into folds
 {
  split(sample(n),rep(1:folds,length=length(y)))
 }
#Write a 
function cv.ksvm <- function(x,y,folds=3,...) 
#which returns a vector ypred of predicted decision score for all points by k-fold cross-validation.
#Compute the various performance of the SVM by 5-fold cross-validation. Alter- natively, the ksvm function can automatically compute the k-fold cross-validation accuracy:
svp <- ksvm(x,y,type="C-svc",kernel=â€™vanilladotâ€™,C=1,scaled=c(),cross=5)
print(cross(svp))
```

PCA on Boston dataset
```{r}
install.packages('MASS')
data(Boston, package="MASS")
# Read the documentation of Boston dataset in RStudio to understand the dataset
help(Boston)
# Principal Component Analysis
# the prcomp() fucntion computes the principal components and we have turned on scalling
# Read the documentation for prcompt() function in RStudio
help(prcomp)
pca_out <- prcomp(Boston,scale. = T)
# pca_out shows the loadings that used.
pca_out
plot(pca_out)

# plotting using the biplot()
# Read the documentation for biplot() function in RStudio
help(biplot)

biplot(pca_out, scale = 0)
boston_pc <- pca_out$x
boston_pc
# boston_pc has the Principal Components having the same number of rows in the original dataset
head(boston_pc)
summary(boston_pc)

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
